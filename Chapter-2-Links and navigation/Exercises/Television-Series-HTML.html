      <b>High-Stakes Rescue:</b>
      <p>
        Tyler Rake, a skilled but haunted black-market mercenary, is tasked with a seemingly impossible mission:
        rescue Ovi Mahajan Jr., the kidnapped teenage son of a notorious Indian drug lord, from Dhaka, Bangladesh.
      </p><br>

      <b>Double-Crossed:</b>
      <p>
        Rake assembles a team and infiltrates Dhaka, successfully extracting Ovi.
        However, the mission takes a sharp turn when they discover they've been double-crossed.
        The city is on lockdown, and rival gangs are out for blood.
      </p><br>

      <b>Fight for Survival:</b>
      <p>
        With dwindling resources and mounting pressure, Rake and Ovi must fight their way through a brutal landscape
        of corrupt officials, ruthless mercenaries, and fierce shootouts.
      </p><br>

      <b>Haunted Past:</b>
      <p>
        As they navigate the treacherous path to escape, glimpses of Rake's troubled past and his motivation for taking
        the job are revealed.
      </p><br>

      <b>Uncertain Fate:</b>
      <p>

      <h6>Reception</h6>

      <b>Viewership</b>
      <p>Extraction was the most-streamed item in its first weekend, but slid to sixth position (third among films) in its second week.<br> Netflix predicted that the film would be seen by about 90 million households in its first month of release, making it the most successful premiere in the service's history.<br> During the July 4th weekend, the picture re-entered the site's top ten.<br> In July 2020, Netflix announced that the film had been seen by 99 million households in its first four weeks of release, the highest number ever for one of their original films.<br> Variety stated in November that the picture was the fourth-most watched straight-to-streaming release in 2020 at the time.</p><br>

      <b>Critical response</b>
      <p>Based on 214 reviews, the movie has a 67% approval rating and an average rating of 6.2/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.<br> The opinion among the website's critics is as follows: "Extraction's aimless violence can't be saved, even with spectacular stunt work and an electrifying performance from Chris Hemsworth."<br> The movie has received "mixed or average reviews" on Metacritic, where it has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 35 critics.</p><br>

      <p>"With one of the most stunning action scenes in recent memory... [the film] is breakneck and bonkers," observed Rohan Nahar of the Hindustan Times,<br> praising Hemsworth and Hooda's performances.Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly rated the movie "B" and stated that it "mostly delivers what its swaggering trailer promises:<br> international scenery; insidious villains; a taciturn, tree-trunk Aussie."</p><br>

      <p>"Aiming for the fight poetry of the John Wick franchise,<br> Extraction comes closer to a series of stunts strung together to look like an ultraviolent video game (think Manhunt 2) in which the avatars are played by actual humans,"<br> wrote Rolling Stone writer Peter Travers, who gave the movie two out of five stars.</p><br>

      <p>Several sites attacked Extraction for having characteristics of a "white saviour."<br> Screen Rant described the movie as having "regressive white saviour elements"<br> that pull it down, while Variety referred to it as "a white-saviour version of Man on Fire."<br> Forbes' Scott Mendelson said the following in an overall positive review: "Look, let's get this straight.<br> Though it's a 'problematic' white Saviour movie, director Sam Hargrave and writer Joe Russo's Extraction is nevertheless a strong action-adventure.</p><br>

      <p>The Daily Star voiced alarm over how Dhaka was portrayed, referring to it as "bleak and inaccurate, but Dhaka nonetheless".<br> Regarding the way Dhaka and Bangladesh are portrayed in the movie, BBC Bangla has noticed a lot of internet criticism.</p><br>

      <b>Accolades</b>
      <p>The Visual Effects Society nominated Marko Forker, Craig Wentworth, Lynzi Grant, and Olivier Sarda<br> for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature at the 19th Visual Effects Society Awards on April 6, 2021.</p><br>
